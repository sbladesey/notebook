# One Pot Beef Stew
---

**Ingredients**:

* 2 pounds beef stew meat
* 1/2 cup all purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon seasoned salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 1 medium yellow onion, diced
* 2 stalks celery, diced
* 3 cups water
* 3 teaspoons (heaping) Better than Bouillon (concentrated beef stock)
* 1 tsp minced garlic
* 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 3 large carrots, peeled and diced
* 4 russet potatoes, diced into chunks

**Recipe**:

1. Cut up stew meat into 1" chunks. In a large Ziploc bag, add flour, seasoned salt and pepper.
2. Seal bag and shake to combine ingredients.
3. Add in stew meat.
4. Shake well to coat with flour.
5. In a large pot, over high heat, pour in vegetable oil.
6. Once the oil is hot, add floured beef chunks (in two batches).
7. Brown half of the beef chunks then do a second batch until they are all browned. Don't fully cook the meat - just brown it.
8. Take out the browned beef and set aside.
9. Season with pepper.
10. If necessary add a tad bit more oil to the pot, turn down the heat to medium, then add in diced onion and celery.
11. Cook until translucent (just a few minutes.)
12. Scrape the bottom of the pan and loosen any brown bits (lots of flavor in those!)
13. Add water and concentrated beef stock, Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir well.
14. Add meat back to the pot.
15. Then toss in diced carrots and potatoes.
16. Stir to combine.
17. Cover and cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes, then turn down the heat to low and allow to simmer for 35-45 minutes (until potatoes are fork tender.)
18. Give stew a stir every so often while cooking.
